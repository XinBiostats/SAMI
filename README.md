We present a method for the simultaneous analysis of spatial metabolome, lipidome, and glycome from a single tissue section using mass spectrometry imaging. Our workflow includes a computational pipeline called __Spatial Augmented Multiomics Interface (SAMI)__ that offers multiomics integration, high dimensionality clustering, spatial anatomical mapping with matched multiomics features, and metabolic pathway enrichment to providing unprecedented insights into the spatial distribution and interaction of these biomolecules in mammalian tissue biology.

## Implement
SAMI can be run through two different ways:

### 1. Using Docker (Recommended):
We have pre-configured the environment for you using Docker, which ensures a consistent and reliable environment and make it easy to get started.

#### Steps:
- Clone SAMI from Github Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XinBiostats/SAMI
```
- Download [testing data](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/qjdk94golwij84xfii15b/h?rlkey=etrdydm1iw86ntcprbem2wivn&dl=1) from Dropbox and put it in "./SAMI/datasets/".
- Download libararies for pathway enrichment analysis from Dropbox and put them in "./SAMI/lib/".
- Download __Docker__ desktop from [Docker website](https://www.docker.com), and install it on your machine.
- Open the Terminal or PowerShell(Windows), then run this command with your SAMI path (eg.docker run -it --rm --user root -e GRANT_SUDO=yes -p 8888:8888 -v "__/Users/xin.ma/Desktop/SAMI__:/home/jovyan/work" xinbiostats/sami:latest)
```bash
docker run -it --rm --user root -e GRANT_SUDO=yes -p 8888:8888 -v "YOUR_SAMI_PATH:/home/jovyan/work" xinbiostats/sami:latest
```


1. Download SAMI:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XinBiostats/SAMI
```
2. Requirements: SAMI is implemented by both Python and R. To install requirements
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
## Usage
1. Download data from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/qjdk94golwij84xfii15b/h?rlkey=etrdydm1iw86ntcprbem2wivn&dl=1) and put downloaded data into datasets folder.
2. Activate SAMI environment, find your R installation's home directory.
   ```bash
   conda activate SAMI
   
   R RHOME
   ```
   For example:
   ```bash
   /Users/xin.ma/anaconda3/envs/SAMI/lib/R
   ```
   Open [./SAMI/pathway.py](https://github.com/XinBiostats/SAMI/blob/main/SAMI/pathway.py) scripts, update os.environ['R_HOME'] using your R home directory.
   ```python
   os.environ['R_HOME'] = "/Users/xin.ma/anaconda3/envs/SAMI/lib/R"
   ```
4. We created demo files([demo](https://github.com/XinBiostats/SAMI/blob/main/demo)) to demonstrate how to use SAMI. The results will be displayed inline and stored in [results](https://github.com/XinBiostats/SAMI/tree/main/results) folder.
